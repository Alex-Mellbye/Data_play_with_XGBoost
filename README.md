# Data_play_with_XGBoost

In this repository is the code I wrote for a veyr simple, fun and easy XGBoost machine learning project

The data is available here:

As the data was already cleaned and prepared, very little work was needed except to apply the machine learning methodology.

For my own part, the most interesting part of this data-project was to apply a multiclass classification model.
